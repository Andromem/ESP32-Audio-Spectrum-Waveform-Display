# ESP32-8-Octave-Audio-Spectrum-Display
Using an ESP32 and OLED display together with an FFT to display audio as 8-octaves in the frequency domain.

An improved version solely for the ESP32 that has increased the resolution in the frequency domain by a factor of 4, giving an improved dynamic range. Code improvements have also been made to speed up the processing together with a shorter code length.

The Font file is needed to display enough characters across the screen to enable each band to be clearly denoted. The bands are:

125Hz
250Hz
500Hz
1KHz
2Khz
4KHz
8Khz
16kHz



Please note, if you feed audio in to the ESP32 ADC port from a microphone it is highly likely (unless of very high quality) that it and the speakers used have sufficient quality to ensure you are getting a flat frequency response from the Fast Fourier Transform and eventual display of the results. The only way to ensure you see the correct result will be by feed approximately 50mV to 100mV pk-pk of audio directly into the ADC port with no DC offset. This is not a fault with the software or display or FFT - itâ€™s the laws of physics!
